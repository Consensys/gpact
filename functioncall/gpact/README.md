General Purpose Atomic Crosschain Transaction (GPACT)
------------------------------
GPACT is a function call protocol that provide a synchronous,
composable programming model and atomic updates across blockchains.
By "atomic updates" it is meant that either state updates are committed on all
blockchains or are discarded on all blockchains. 

The function calls can update state on each blockchain and return values across 
blockchains. The protocol enables applications to access information and 
utilise functionality that resides on one blockchain from other blockchains. 
Unlike previous atomic crosschain protocols that only offer atomic asset 
swaps, this protocol allows for general purpose application logic.
