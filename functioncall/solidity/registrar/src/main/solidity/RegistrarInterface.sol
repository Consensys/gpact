/**
 * Registrar contracts hold the public keys used to verify transaction roots from blockchains.
 *
 * A set of addresses are administrators for the contract. The administrators vote to add
 * other administrators, remove administrators, change the voting contract, add blockchains,
 * and add and remove public keys. The account that deploys the contract is the initial
 * administrator.
 *
 * When the contract is first deployed there is no voting contract. In this mode of operation,
 * all proposed votes are immediately acted upon. That is, there is no voting. When a voting
 * algorithm is in place the voting has the following process:
 *
 * proposeVote: An administrator proposes a vote. The address is deemed to have voted for the proposal.
 * vote: During the voting period all administrators can vote for or against the proposal.
 * actionVote: At any point after the voting period, any administrator can call this function to enact the vote.
 *
 * The only signature algorithm supported in this version are ECDSA / KECCAK256 using secp256k1 curve.
 * Public keys are represented as addresses. Implementer are strongly suggested to use a separate key
 * pair for each blockchain and in particular not to use a transaction root signing key pair for
 * Ethereum transaction signing. The reasons for this are: reduce the impact caused by a compromised
 * private key, different key roll-over schedules, differing security requirements around the storage
 * and operation of the private keys, given the differing usages.
