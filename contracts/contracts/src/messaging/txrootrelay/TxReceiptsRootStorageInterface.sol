     * Ethereum transaction receipts are arranged as a Merkle Patricia Trie, with the leaf nodes of the trie being
     * the transaction receipts. The message digest of the nodes are included in the nodes next closer to the root
     * of the trie.
     *
     * If there is just one transaction in a block, then there is only one leaf node for the one transaction
     * receipt. The message digest is the transaction receipt root. In this case _proof and _proofOffsets are
     * empty arrays.
     *
     * If there are between two and sixteen transactions, there will be between two and sixteen leaf nodes to match
     * the transactions, plus a branch node. The RLP encoded branch node is the only element of _proof. The
     * message digest of this value must match the transaction receipt root. The message digest of _txReceipt must be
     * present in the RLP encoded branch node (that is the element of _proof) at the offset specified by _proofOffsets.
     *
     * If there are between seventeen and two hundred and fifty-six transactions, then there will be two layers of branch
     * nodes in the Merkle Patricia Trie, in addition to the leaf nodes. In this case, _proof and _proofOffsets will
     * have two elements, matching the two layers. The offsets in _proofOffsets allow the message digests to be
     * found in the next level up proof.

     * @param _blockchainId Identifier of blockchain that the transaction receipt belongs to
