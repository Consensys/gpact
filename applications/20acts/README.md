20 ACTS Protocol
----------------
The ERC 20 Atomic Crosschain Transaction (20ACTs) protocol is a research project. 
It aims at creating a light weight two-phase commitment scheme for transfer
of assets across blockchains.

This protocol sits on top of the Crosschain Messaging Layer. It is a 
specialised application, and hence does not use a Crosschain Function Call 
Layer implementation.

An explanation of the protocol will be made public in the future.
